# coding-events-demo

1) The purpose of this app is to create and keep track of events.

2) Currently this app allows you to create, view, and delete events. Events require a category, which you can create new types of on the app. Also you can
create tags to add to the events as well.

3) The app is going to be improved by adding a person class. This class will have first and last name fields along with users email. The person class might
reference a person details class that includes their profile information along with a list of events they are interested in attending and events that they have created.
This would be a many-to-many relationship with attending events as a person can attend multiple events and an event can have multiple people attending. The relationship to
created events list would be one to many as a person can create multiple events but events can only be created by a single person.
